# Address-Registry-Creator

### Demonstrates the functionality and usage of Linked Lists in C++

This small program demonstrates how to create and manipulate linked lists in C++. It creates a functioning
address book application, that is accessible through the terminal.  It records the Name, Address, Phone Number, 
and Date of Birth in each entry, and stores it in created classes. The program demonstrates the various aspects 
of dealing with linked lists, such as iteration, adding new nodes, and deleting nodes.  The program outputs the
list to a text file of the user's choosing.
